A langage for programming 
Is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instruction to perform specific tasks on a com puter or computer device.
The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages, such as BASIC , C , C++, COBOL, Java, FORTRAN, Ada,
and Pascal.Each programming language has a unique set of keywords (words it understands), and a special syntax to organize instructions for the program. 
Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions in a language which the computer understands to a computer.Just as many human-based languages exist, there are an number of computer programming languages that programmers can use to communicate with a computer. 
-Programming languages at a broad level 
High-level programming languages are more complex than the languages the machine actually understands, although they are simple compared to human languages,High-level programming languages are more complex than the languages the machine actually understands, although they are simple compared to human languages,Called machine languages Each type of CPU has a unique machine language of its own. 
Lying between machine languages and languages of high level are languages which are called assembly language. Assembly languages are similar to machine languages but are much easier to program in as they allow a programmer to replace numbers with names.Machine languages are composed only of numbers. 
Lying above are languages called languages of the fourth generation (usually abbreviated 4GL). 4GLs are distant from machine languages and represent the closest class of computer languages to human languages.
